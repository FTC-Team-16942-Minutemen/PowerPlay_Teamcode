# PowerPlay (2022) TeamCode
This source code should be placed into the TeamCode/src directory of the FtcRobotController project (specifically download the "FtcRobotController_PowerPlay2022" branch from the forked FtcRobotController from the Minutemen/16942's main github org. page).

The FtcRobotController_PowerPlay2022 branch should contain already any gradle dependencies (i.e. imported libraries) for: 

* FTClib, command-based architecture for WPIlib-like control of FTC robots
* Roadrunner, a path-planning and path following library/source
* Easy-OpenCV, an implementation of openCV for java made for running on the REV robot controller (part of openFTC)
* April tag detection add-on for easy-openCV (also part of openFTC)
